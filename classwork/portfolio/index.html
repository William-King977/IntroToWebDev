				<p>I like to work on my own projects to help demonstrate my programming knowledge. Some projects include 
					<i>Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms</i>, <i>Tawe-Lib</i> and <i>Handwritten Digit Recognition</i>.
					These are all available to view on my <a href = "https://github.com/William-King977" target = "_blank">

				<p>Other than that, I go swimming, do a bit of weight training, and watch Strongman. </p>

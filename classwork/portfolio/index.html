		<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
		<p>Hello my name is William, from Hertfordshire and I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Swansea University.</p>
		
		<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
		<p>Not much to say other than my Jewsons Ltd placement in Harpenden and that I achieved a black belt in Tae Kwon Do
			in 2014.</p>
		
		<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
		<p>I like to work on my own projects to help demonstrate my programming knowledge. Some projects include
			<i>Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms</i>, <i>Tawe-Lib</i> and <i>Handwritten Digit Recognition</i>. 
			Other than that, I go swimming, do a bit of weight training, and watch Strongman.</p>
